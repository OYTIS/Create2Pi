# Pi HAT for iRobot Create

iRobot Create Open Interface is a 7-pin mini-DIN connector exposing unregulated battery power pin and 5V UART. The HAT contains a power regulator to convert the battery power to 5V, and a level shifter to interface Roomba UART with Raspberry's 3.3V UART. Also a USB-Serial interface is added for convenience.
